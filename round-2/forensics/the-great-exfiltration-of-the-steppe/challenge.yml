  The year is 1227… or is it 2027?
  Whispers spread across the steppes that Genghis Khan has returned — but not with horsemen and bows. Instead, his Cyber Horde rides the waves of the Internet, launching raids across the digital Silk Road.

  Your mission is to stop one of his elite cyber-warriors. Intelligence suggests that the Horde has stolen a flag of power and exfiltrated it piece by piece using covert channels. Our monitoring systems captured strange traffic, but the data is fragmented and encrypted.
  Luckily every artifact is collected and presented to you. Good luck!
