  Some truths are split, hiding in plain sight.

  Among the files you will find:
    - secret.enc : a mysterious file locked away
    - cover.png : an image with a story hidden inside
    - logs.txt : cryptic traces left behind
    - config.txt : mundane notes that may or may not help
  Combine the scattered pieces carefully and see what emerges. Every artifact has its role.
