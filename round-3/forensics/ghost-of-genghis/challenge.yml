  1200 AD, The Mongol Empire: Genghis Khan's war machine was unstoppable. But what historians never recorded was his most secret weapon - The Silent Horde, a cyber warfare division centuries ahead of its time.

  The descendants of The Silent Horde have awakened. Calling themselves "The Ghost of Genghis," they've launched a cyber campaign using ancient Mongolian encryption techniques combined with modern ransomware tactics. Their goal: to establish a digital empire that would make their ancestor proud.

  Your forensic team has discovered that a critical server has been compromised. The attackers left behind their signature - a ransomware strain called "SteppeStorm" that encrypts files using algorithms based on Genghis Khan's battle formations.
